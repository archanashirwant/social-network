            Playdate is a smart  solution for  the parents to find playdates for their kids and to meet up with other like minded parents.
            On Playdate, we show you other parents in your neighborhood with similar-aged children and create matches based on shared interests.
            You can chat, arrange meetups and share experiences based on meaningful topics.
            Your child will make new friends...and you will too!."
